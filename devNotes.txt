I wanted to create this to avoid making a big if/else statement block that changes the ripper's name across several rips. I thought it would have been easier and more effective to use a JSON file for it where it uses two properties, which are songName and the song ripper(s).
It uses the in-game song title instead of the ID of the song, so it accounts for variations of the same song (i.e. Pico mixes).

Just got done with what I would consider an overhaul of this script as the initial idea has changed
This is meant for crediting song rippers from SilvaGunner remixes, now you can credit any contributor who contributed to the making of the song (i.e. Artist, animation, coder).
